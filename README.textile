h1. Puppet-Sync

This project provides a script to synchronize you manifests from a GIT
repository to your Puppet master.

h2. Usage

To sync a specific branch, to specific location, from a specific repository run the
script with the following arguments:

  puppet-sync --branch master \
              --destination /etc/puppet/environments \
              --repository ssh+git://git/puppet.git

h2. Git Hook

I usually call this script from a GIT hook. If your GIT repository is located
on a different server as your Puppet master, you will need to ensure that
a certain user can login to your Puppet server, without manual interactions.

  # create a puppet-sync user
  useradd puppet-sync

  # change to the user
  sudo su - puppet-sync

  # generate a ssh key
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

  # copy the ssh key to your puppet master (where you have already
  # created the puppet-sync user too ;-))
  scp ~puppet-sync/.ssh/id_rsa.pub puppet:/home/puppet-sync/.ssh


Now you need to add the following line to the Git file:

  echo "sudo -u psync ssh puppet01.in.ixolit.com /usr/local/bin/psync \$branch" >> /git/puppet.git/hooks/post-update
  echo "exec git-update-server-info" >> /git/puppet.git/hooks/post-update
